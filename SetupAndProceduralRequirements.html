      Requirements</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are two facets for the daily trasmits, configuration and procedure.</p>
    <p>Configuration is an initial one time setup, with possible operations
      necessitated by changes to your business flow. Configuration involves <a
        href="">setting up and output directory</a>, <a href="">creating GL
        Codes</a>, and <a href="">assigning GL Codes to Sub-Categories and
        Payment methods.</a></p>
    <p>Procedurally there are two main functions to perform to generate files,
      as well as a Monthly Process. The daily process is to first do all <a href="">shift
        reconciliations</a> for the day, then run the <a href="">day end</a>
      process for the day.</p>
    <p>Although not strictly necessary for daily transmit files, there is an
      additional process after a month is complete. When running the day end
      process you will also generate Business Date Reports, and any with monthly
      or yearly totals are dependent on the <a href="">Month End</a><a> Process
        being run when a month is finished.</a></p>
